    "* **set**: Keyword for the set data type in Python. A set variable may contain from empty set to multiple set elements, where every element must be unique in its value in the set.\n",
    "* **Subset**: A subset of a set contains exclusively a portion of the set's elements, and hence the subset cannot contain any elements that are not in the set.\n",
    "* **Superset**: The set with respect to its subset in the above definition is also called a superset. In other words, a superset of a set must contain all the elements in the set.\n",
    "* **Hashing**: Hashing refers to a calculation by a hash function that maps an object to a fixed value.\n",
    "* **MD5**: A popular hash function that generates 128-bit hash value, also known as Message-Digest algorithm version 5."

Otherwise, the reference from the Table of Contents does not faithfully represent the content. \n",

As a result, if your strategy is to increase the i value in a loop, it will be wise to adaptively change the step size such that the loop does not have to enumerate all the integers before the smallest integer value that satsifies the condition is found."
